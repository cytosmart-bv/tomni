def circularity(contour: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the circularity of a contour.

    The circularity of a contour is a measure of how closely it resembles a perfect circle.
    It is calculated based on the contour's area and perimeter using the formula:

    circularity = (4 * Ï€ * area) / (perimeter^2)

    Where:
    - area is the area enclosed by the contour.
    - perimeter is the length of the contour.

    A perfectly circular contour will have a circularity of 1, while more irregular contours
    will have circularity values closer to 0.

    Args:
        contour (np.ndarray): The contour represented as an OpenCV ndarray.

    Returns:
        float: The circularity value, where 0 < circularity <= 1.

    Example:
        >>> contour = np.array([[[1, 2]], [[2, 3]], [[3, 2]], [[2, 1]]])
        >>> circularity(contour)
        0.7853981633974483  # Approximate circularity of a square.

    # calculate size
    area = cv2.contourArea(contour)

    # calculate shape
    perimeter = cv2.arcLength(contour, True)

    circularity = (4 * np.pi * area) / (perimeter**2)

    return circularity
