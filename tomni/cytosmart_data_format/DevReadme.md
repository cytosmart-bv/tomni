Tomni CytoSmartDataFormat Update
=====

Hello people, This is a todo list for the new CytoSmart data format (CDF). File can be removed once development is done. The intention of the CDF is two fold. First, to offer a data class that handles annotations, data manipulation, creates generators/lists, and provides summaries/features for algorithms. Second, to provide a data class standard that other teams can use, e.g. the cloud, where we have clear defined scope of what it can and cannot do, and well it's documented.
