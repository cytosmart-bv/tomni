.. py:function:: labels2contours(labels: numpy.ndarray, simplify_error: float = 0, return_inner_contours: bool = False) -> list

   Transform an image with labels into OpenCV contours.

   :param numpy.ndarray labels: An array where each pixel is labeled to indicate which object it belongs to.
   :param float simplify_error: Deprecated. The amount of error allowed while simplifying the contours (default is 0).
   :param bool return_inner_contours: Return internal contours (default is False). These contours surround holes within the main contour.
   :return: A list of OpenCV contours representing objects in the labeled image.
   :rtype: list

This function takes an array of labels where each pixel indicates which object it belongs to and transforms it into a list of OpenCV contours. Each contour represents an object in the labeled image.

Example Usage::

   import numpy as np

   # Create an array of labels
   labels = np.array([[0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]], dtype=np.uint8)

   # Get OpenCV contours from the labeled image
   contours = labels2contours(labels)

   # Process the contours as needed

.. warning::
   - The `simplify_error` parameter is deprecated and no longer supported. Setting it to a non-zero value will have no effect.
   - This function relies on `labels2listsOfPoints` and `positions2contour` functions to convert labels to contours.
   - The input labels should be a 2D numpy array where each pixel is labeled with an object ID.

You can save this documentation in a `.rst` file, such as `labels2contours.rst`, and use Sphinx to generate documentation from it. Make sure to replace the function usage example with your specific information and documentation needs.
