Tomni
=====

Tomni is created by CytoSMART.
The package was developed in house to centralize helper function for computer vision problems.
But in 2021 we went open source with it.

Tomni contains a collection of helpers functions based on openCV and numpy.
It used the image coordinates (same as openCV, different from numpy).
