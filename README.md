Tomni is a python package that contains a collection of helper functions based on OpenCV and NumPy. It can be used for any python based computer vision or image analysis problem. The package simplifies the code and takes care of edge cages, everything from simplifying code like img_dim to compute optimization like labels2contours or illumination correction image processing. Tomni uses the image coordinates (same as OpenCV).

Tomni is created by [CytoSMART](https://cytosmart.com).

The package was developed in-house to centralize the helper function for computer vision problems. In 2021, CytoSMART engineers turned it to open source, enabling researchers and educators to use it for free.

## Getting Tomni

```cmd
pip install tomni
```

## License

Tomni is free for academic and educational use.

For commercial use please contact [CytoSMART](https://cytosmart.com/contact).

## The name

The name Tomni is a combination of creator (Tom) and other CytoSMART product he was working on, [the Omni](https://cytosmart.com/products/omni). Tomni name was proposed by Denissa Daroţi, a former CytoSMART intern, who won a bet with her mentor by getting a (well deserved) 9/10 for her internship.
